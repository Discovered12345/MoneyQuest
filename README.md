MoneyQuest is an interactive web platform designed to make financial literacy fun, accessible, and impactful for teens and young adults. In a world where many students graduate without knowing how to manage a budget, use credit wisely, or understand basic economics, MoneyQuest steps in as a gamified learning experience that empowers users with real-life financial skills.

At its core, MoneyQuest uses story-based simulations where users make decisions in common financial scenarios — from managing a first paycheck to dealing with unexpected expenses or choosing between a loan and savings. Each choice teaches a lesson, and users earn points, badges, and progress on a community leaderboard.

Built with accessibility and simplicity in mind, MoneyQuest is fun and beginner-friendly. Whether you're just starting to learn about money or want to test your knowledge in a fun way, MoneyQuest offers a supportive and engaging space to level up your financial confidence — one quest at a time.
